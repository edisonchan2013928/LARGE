# LARGE
This is the implementation of our paper "LARGE: A Length-Aggregation-based Grid Structure for Line Density Visualization", which is currently submitted to VLDB 2024.

# Our Code
Our code is written in C++, which only depends on the C++ Standard Library (i.e., no additional library is used). Therefore, readers can test our code using the Cygwin software (for Windows OS) and the Terminal (for Linux OS), without any additional software/hardware. We have provided the shell script file "compile_and_run.sh" (in the "Code" folder) for showing how to compile and run our code. In particular, we have provided detailed descriptions of all parameters and an example for calling our code in "compile_and_run.sh".

# Datasets
Due to space limitations in this Github link, we do not upload the datasets. However, since all datasets are open to public, readers can simply download these datasets from the source webpages (cf. the "Ref." column in Table 1). To call our code properly, readers need to process these datasets based on our input file structure, which is shown in the file "input_file_structure.txt".

# Output results
After readers call our code, they will obtain an output text file that contains output results. This output text file is based on our output file structure, which is shown in the "output_file_structure.txt".
